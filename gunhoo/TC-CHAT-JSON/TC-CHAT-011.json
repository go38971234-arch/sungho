            "answer": "🌱 What is Photosynthesis?\nPhotosynthesis is the process plants, algae, and some bacteria use to:\nTake in: light energy (sun), CO₂ (air), water (soil)\nMake: sugar (chemical energy) and oxygen\nIn one sentence:\n👉 Plants act like tiny solar panels that turn light into stored food energy.\n🔬 The Basic Formula\nIn a simplified “chemical sentence”:\n6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂\n(carbon dioxide + water + light → glucose + oxygen)\nCO₂: from the air, through tiny pores called stomata on leaves\nH₂O: from the soil, through roots\nLight: usually from the sun, absorbed by chlorophyll in chloroplasts\n🧩 Step-by-Step: How It Works\n1. Light Absorption 🌞\nInside leaf cells are chloroplasts.\nInside chloroplasts is chlorophyll (the green pigment).\nChlorophyll absorbs mainly blue and red light, and reflects green (so plants look green).\n2. Light Reactions ⚡ (in the thylakoid membranes)\nIn this stage, the plant:\nUses light energy to:\nSplit water:\nH₂O → O₂ + H⁺ + e⁻\n→ O₂ (oxygen) is released into the air.\nProduces:\nATP (energy currency)\nNADPH (high-energy electron carrier)\nYou can think of this as charging the plant’s battery.\n3. Calvin Cycle (Dark Reactions) 🧱 (in the stroma)\nThis stage:\nDoesn’t require light directly, but uses ATP and NADPH from the light reactions.\nTakes in CO₂ and, through several enzyme steps, builds it into glucose (sugar).\nIn human terms:\nLight reactions = “Earn energy & tools”\nCalvin cycle = “Use those tools to build sugar bricks from CO₂”\n🌳 Real-Life Examples\nExample 1: A Tree in a Park\nInput:\nSunlight hitting the leaves\nCO₂ from car exhaust, people breathing, air in general\nWater from soil (rain, sprinkler)\nProcess:\nChlorophyll in the leaves absorbs light.\nWater is split → oxygen goes into the air.\nCO₂ is converted into sugar.\nOutput:\nSugars are used:\nTo grow new branches, leaves, roots\nTo store as starch in trunks/roots\nOxygen is released for animals (and us) to breathe.\nExample 2: Rice Plant in a Paddy Field 🌾\nInput:\nStrong sunlight\nLots of water in the flooded field\nCO₂ from the air\nProcess:\nLeaves perform photosynthesis, make sugar.\nSugars move to growing grains.\nOutput:\nGrains fill with starch (stored energy).\nThis becomes rice that humans and animals eat.\nExample 3: Algae in a Pond 🐟\nMicroscopic algae float near the surface.\nThey use sunlight + CO₂ dissolved in water.\nThey produce oxygen that fish and other aquatic organisms need.\n🧠 Why Photosynthesis Matters\nBasis of the food chain\nPlants make the original sugars.\nAnimals eat plants (or eat animals that ate plants).\n→ Almost all food energy on Earth started as sunlight.\nOxygen production\nThe oxygen we breathe is largely from photosynthesis.\nCarbon dioxide control\nPhotosynthesis removes CO₂ from the atmosphere, affecting climate.\n🪄 Super Simple Analogy\nImagine a tiny “solar-powered kitchen” inside each leaf:\nSolar panels = chlorophyll\nElectricity = light energy → ATP, NADPH\nIngredients = CO₂ (air), water (soil)\nChef = enzymes (especially RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle)\nDish = glucose (sugar)\nBy-product = oxygen (goes out the window a.k.a. stomata)\nIf you’d like, next we can make:\nA short Korean + English summary for memorizing, or\nA diagram-style explanation you could turn into notes or a slide."
